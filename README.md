# AntColonyOptimization

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The project includes functions to generate random distances between cities, visualize these distances, and apply the ACO algorithm to find the shortest path.

## Description (optional)

The project demonstrates the use of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to find the shortest path through a set of cities. The algorithm mimics the behavior of ants searching for food and depositing pheromones, which guide other ants towards the shortest route. The project also includes functions to generate random distances between cities and visualize the distance matrix.

## Features

- Generates random distances between cities.
- Visualizes the distance matrix using a heatmap.
- Implements the ACO algorithm to find the shortest path.
- Visualizes the best path found by the ACO algorithm.

## Usage

To run the script, you need to have Python installed along with the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries. You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib
